Customer churn Analysis using Machine Learning

📌 Project Overview

Customer churn is a major challenge for telecom and service-based companies. When customers leave, businesses face revenue loss and increased acquisition costs.

This project focuses on predicting customer churn in advance using Machine Learning, so businesses can take early action to retain customers.

The project follows a complete end-to-end data science workflow, from data preprocessing to model deployment using a Flask web application.

🎯 Objectives

Predict whether a customer will churn or not

Analyze customer behavior using historical data

Help businesses identify high-risk customers early

Reduce customer loss through data-driven decisions

🧩 Business Problem

Telecom companies lose customers frequently

Churn is usually detected after the customer has already left

Manual analysis is inefficient and slow

👉 Solution: Build a predictive system that identifies churn before it happens.

📁 Dataset Description

The dataset contains customer demographic and service-related information.

Key Features Used:

Contract Type

Tenure

Payment Method

Monthly Charges

Total Charges

Paperless Billing

Senior Citizen

Target Variable:

Churn (Yes / No)

Evaluation based on test dataset

Optimized using hyperparameter tuning

💡 Business Insights

Customers with short tenure are more likely to churn

Month-to-month contracts have higher churn rates

Long-term contracts reduce churn

Payment methods influence customer retention

📊 Business Impact

Early identification of churn-prone customers

Improved customer retention strategies

Reduced revenue loss

Supports data-driven decision making

🚀 Future Scope

Add more customer behavior features

Build real-time churn monitoring dashboard

Integrate with CRM systems

Regular model retraining with new data
